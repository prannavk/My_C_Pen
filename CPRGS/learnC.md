# IMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING C

---

- C Tokens = { Keywords, Identifiers, Constants, Operators }
- Operators = { Arithmetic, Logical, Relational, Bitwise, Assignment, Conditional, Termination, Special }
- Operators are of 3 types:
  - Unary (required only 1 operand)
  - Binary (required 2 operands)
  - Ternary (required 3 operands)
- Arithmetic = { +, -, *, /, %, ++, -- } (++ and -- are unary, rest are binary)

## i/o

- scanf(“%X”, &variableOfXType);
  > where %X is the format specifier in C. It is a way to tell the compiler what type of data is in a variable and & is the address operator in C, which tells the compiler to change the real value of this variable, stored at this address in the memory. 
- printf(“%X”, variableOfXType);
